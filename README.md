How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Any good programmer needs to see themselves as the user first. User stories help us figure out what we would want in the project we are working on. It can also help us branch out to others and questions to see what they would need in a product as well. 


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I really like the Sprint and Kanban/Jira idea. Where we have a set amount of time to complete this or that task. I get lost in the details sometimes because of the big picture and using a Kanban board with a time limit will help me get things done. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is to be knowledgeable in your work and be will to help out other coworkers when need. Also, get your work done and don't depend on others to do your work. But don't be afraid to ask question to help you grow.
